excerpt: My statement about first-wave migration of all my stories on Medium to Github Pages. Also some rant about life, and my dream for the future of blog engine. All in less than 500 words.

Today, I made first-wave migrations from Medium. And that's means that I no longer publish new story on Medium.

With this decision I set my soul free from Medium. Next step is to put some deprecated messages to all my stories. However, the migration still vendor-locked to Github. To resolve that issue, I am planning to create static blog engine for static page with local admin dashboard. But, that's not my end-goal, though.

My ultimate dream (end-goal) related to logging thought, is everyone can create blog or micro-thought and free to host everywhere (including IPFS or any static page hosting), but with local-first administration interface (desktop-app) companion. The idea is similar to Hugo but different workflows. My main problem is a free time to create such side project.

I'm jobless when writing this post. So only hope can save my life, hope that someday I can strip all my todos to be done state, and all my side projects show up in the Internet.

This post is not too detailed to describe my migration process, as I write this post with free-writing process, without editing, just stream of thought. But it's such a fun ride until this post published in my personal website.

Oh, I forget to mention that [raitucarp.xyz](https://raitucarp.xyz) is my latest creation to prepare job hunting. I hope I find new job as soon as possible.
